## How to run 
npm install  
npm start  

## Note 1: Pagination

Many components you have to work on such notifications, comments, Currently the api returns http://localhost:8000/whatever however the frontend must call http://jpmoreno.ca/restify/api/


## Note 2: Likes/follows bug

Currently sometimes when a restaurant is liked or followed there is lag updating the follow/like button and the follow/like count. This is something that you do not have to worry about
